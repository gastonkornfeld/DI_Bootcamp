// Exercise 1 : Hello Node.Js
// Create a new folder called - npm-node
// Create a JS file called - main.js
// Add the following code to the file main.js :

let a = 5;
let b = 10;
let x;
let c = 6;
x = a + b;

// Write some more code in the main.js file so when you run it in the command prompt it logs Hello you are 15



console.log(`Hello you are ${x+c}`);


// Create a package.json file - use npm init
// Run the main.js file using npm start.
// Tip: you need to change the package.json file in order to achieve this.
// You should output something in the command prompt, for example: Hi, thanks for running me with npm start!
